%% Deflection Analysis of Bracket
% This example shows how to analyze an idealized 3-D mechanical part under an 
% applied load using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The objective of the analysis 
% is to determine the maximal deflection caused by the load.
%% Create a Structural Analysis Model
% The first step in solving a linear elasticity problem is to create a structural 
% analysis model. This is a container that holds the geometry, structural material 
% properties, body and boundary loads, boundary constraints, and mesh.

model = createpde('structural','static-solid');
%% Import the Geometry
% Import an STL file of a simple bracket model using the |importGeometry| function. 
% This function reconstructs the faces, edges and vertices of the model. It can 
% merge some faces and edges, so the numbers can differ from those of the parent 
% CAD model.
%%
importGeometry(model,'BracketWithHole.stl');
%% 
% Plot the geometry and turn on face labels. You will need the face labels 
% to define the boundary conditions.

%% Specify Structural Properties of the Material
% Specify Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for this material.
%%
structuralProperties(model,'Cell',1,'YoungsModulus',200e9, ...
                                    'PoissonsRatio',0.3);
%% Define the Boundary Conditions
% The problem has two boundary conditions: the back face (face 4) is immobile 
% and the front face has an applied load. All other boundary conditions, by default, 
% are free boundaries.
%%
structuralBC(model,'Face',4,'Constraint','fixed');
%% 
% Apply a distributed load in the negative $z$-direction to the front face 
% (face 8).
%%
distributedLoad = 1e4; % Applied load in Pascals
structuralBoundaryLoad (model,'Face',8,'SurfaceTraction',[0;0;-distributedLoad]);
%% Create a Mesh
% Create a mesh that uses 10-node tetrahedral elements with quadratic interpolation 
% functions. This element type is significantly more accurate than the linear 
% interpolation (four-node) elements, particularly in elasticity analyses that 
% involve bending.
%%
bracketThickness = 1e-2; % Thickness of horizontal plate with hole, meters
generateMesh(model,'Hmax',bracketThickness);

%% Calculate the Solution
% Use |solve| to calculate the solution.
%%
result = solve(model);
%% Examine the Solution
% Find the maximal deflection of the bracket in the $z$ direction.
%%
minUz = min(result.Displacement.uz);
fprintf('Maximal deflection in the z-direction is %g meters.', minUz)
%% Plot Components of the Displacement
% To see the solution, plot the components of the solution vector. The maximal 
% deflections are in the $z$-direction. Because the part and the loading are symmetric, 
% the $x$-displacement and $z$-displacement are symmetric, and the $y$-displacement 
% is antisymmetric with respect to the center line.
% 
% Here, the plotting routine uses the |'jet'| colormap, which has blue as 
% the color representing the lowest value and red representing the highest value. 
% The bracket loading causes face 8 to dip down, so the maximum $z$-displacement 
% appears blue.
